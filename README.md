Multiple chat room with Multiple client.
======


### How to use:
* Download and unzip all the files. You'll also need Python 3 installed.
* To run server: 

"host"(optional) is the ip address your server is running on. 

python3 pychat_server.py [host]


* To run client: "host"(not optional) should be the same ip address as the server

python3 pychat_client.py host
 
 After running server file output would be something like this :
